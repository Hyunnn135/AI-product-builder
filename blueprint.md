# Project Blueprint: Lunch Menu Recommender

## Overview
This project is a simple web application that provides random lunch menu recommendations to the user. It is built using modern web standards (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) without external frameworks.

## Project Outline
### Version 1.0 (Initial Implementation)
*   **Purpose:** Provide a basic interface for lunch menu recommendations.
*   **Features:**
    *   `index.html`: Contains the main structure of the page, including a title, a paragraph to display the recommendation, and a button to trigger a new recommendation.
    *   `style.css`: Provides basic styling for the page, centering content, setting fonts, and styling the button.
    *   `main.js`: Implements the core logic. It defines a list of diverse lunch menus, and on button click, it randomly selects and displays one of the menus in the designated paragraph.

## Current Plan
The initial version of the lunch menu recommender page (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) has been implemented. The core functionality of displaying random recommendations on button click is working.
